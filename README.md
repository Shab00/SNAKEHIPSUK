### Feature Engineering
This section focuses on creating new features from the existing ones to potentially improve the model's performance. Two new features are engineered.

### Creating Target Variable and Data Cleaning
This section defines the target variable for the machine learning model and performs some data cleaning.

### Defining the Model Architecture
This code defines a function `get_model` that creates and compiles a neural network model and prints a detailed classification report.

## requirements.txt
Contains the list of required packages for running the Jupyter Notebook.

# Key Model Performance Metrics

## Precision
- For class 0 (not popular): 0.92
- For class 1 (popular): 0.85

## Recall
- For class 0: 0.86
- For class 1: 0.92

## F1-Score
- Both classes: around 0.88

## Support
- Class 0: 14 samples
- Class 1: 12 samples

## Accuracy
- 0.88

The model demonstrates strong performance overall, with high accuracy and good precision and recall for both classes. The slight difference in precision and recall between the classes suggests that the model might be slightly better at identifying "popular" videos than "not popular" videos.
